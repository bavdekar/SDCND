# The Finding Lanes Project

This is the first project that I completed as a part of the nano-degee programme.
The first thing about driving cars is safety. One important aspect of safety is to drive within your designated lane (unless changing it). When humans drive, their eyes can see the edges of their lane and periodically steer their car so that it stays within the two edges of the lane. Our eyes can easily see the edges, and our brain can easily interpret that those edges shouldn't be crossed. Thus, the challenge for autonomous cars is to, first, be able to see the road, and second, detect the edges of the lane.

In this project, I have implemented a lane-edge detection algorithm using Python and its associated packages. This README file will guide you through how the lane detection is achieved.
